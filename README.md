# Neural Network Project Using MNIST Dataset

This project is an implementation of a neural network from scratch in Python, designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It showcases the foundational concepts of neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and accuracy evaluation, all built using common Python libraries for data science.

## Features

- Implements a basic neural network with a customizable number of layers and neurons.
- Utilizes the MNIST dataset for training and validation, demonstrating the network's classification capabilities.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy metrics.
- Includes visualization examples of MNIST dataset digits and their classifications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation
